  abstract={In the field of big data analysis, with the help of machine learning algorithms, the traditional mode of data analysis has been changed and the development of data processing and analysis has been promoted. This paper first explains the concepts of machine learning and big data analysis, then introduces the classic concepts and application concepts of three kinds of classical machine learning algorithms, namely naive Bayesian algorithm, K-means algorithm and SVM algorithm, and then discusses the application mode of machine learning algorithm in the emerging stage of big data environment, so as to enhance the value of big data processing. Finally, it looks forward to the big data processing The research trend of machine learning algorithm in this field is analyzed.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of computer information technology, the development of artificial intelligence has been accelerating. The traditional geometry recognition technology is relatively backward and the recognition rate is low. In the face of massive information database, the traditional algorithm model inevitably has the problems of low recognition accuracy and poor performance. Deep learning theory has gradually become a very important part of machine learning. The implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) reduces the difficulty of graphics generation algorithm. In this paper, using the advantages of lenet-5 architecture sharing weights and feature extraction and classification, the proposed geometric pattern recognition algorithm model is faster in the training data set. By constructing the shared feature parameters of the algorithm model, the cross-entropy loss function is used in the recognition process to improve the generalization of the model and improve the average recognition accuracy of the test data set.},

  abstract={Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) excels in tackling intricate decision-making tasks by managing multiple goals simultaneously. To enhance the agentâ€™s exploration and learning capabilities within complex tasks, modular goal representation is first combined with a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we introduce the CLP task priority metric and intrinsic motivation reward function to guide the agent, facilitating cross-module and cross-goal learning for efficient exploration. Furthermore, we implement a Future Goal Relabeling Strategy (FGRS) to diversify goals. Leveraging a learned dynamics model, the short-rollout is performed from the current policy to generate predictive goals, thus improving the efficiency of the policy optimization process. Finally, by integrating the above improvements, model-assisted intrinsically motivated modular hierarchical reinforcement learning (IM3HRL) is proposed. Experimental results in the Modular Goal Fetch Arm test environment demonstrate that IM3HRL outperforms other baseline methods, achieving a minimum 15% improvement in learning speed and exhibiting robustness against forgetting and sensor perturbations. Our research results prove the excellent model performance of IM3HRL and hold significant practical value for GCRL to solve the problem of exploratory learning in complex tasks.},

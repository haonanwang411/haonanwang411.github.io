  abstract  = {Q-learning methods are widely used in robot path planning but often face challenges of inefficient search and slow convergence. We propose an Improved Q-learning (IQL) framework that enhances standard Q-learning in two significant ways. First, we introduce the Path Adaptive Collaborative Optimization (PACO) algorithm to optimize Q-table initialization, providing better initial estimates and accelerating learning. Second, we incorporate a Utility-Controlled Heuristic (UCH) mechanism with dynamically tuned parameters to optimize the reward function, enhancing the algorithmâ€™s accuracy and effectiveness in path-planning tasks. Extensive experiments in three different raster grid environments validate the superior performance of our IQL framework. The results demonstrate that our I

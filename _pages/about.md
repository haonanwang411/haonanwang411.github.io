I am currently a research assistant at the ISLE lab working with [Prof. Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/) in 2025 Spring and a graduate Master's degree in Computer student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in 2024 Fall.

Prior to JHU, I received my B.S. degree in Information and Computer Science, and Mathematics from the [Liaoning Technology University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/). During my undergrad study, I spent time at the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science and the Institute of Machine Learning and Data Mining, where I was advised by [Prof. Wei liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei-Liu-523) and [Prof.Yu Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Zhang-264) working in Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Informatics Theory, Numerical Analysis, and Math Modeling and Optimization Algorithms field.


## Research interest:
My research objective is in the area of the intersection of **human-computer interaction(HCI)**
,**Natural Language Understanding(NLG) and Embodied Agents** evaluation and application and **Reinforcement Learing**. Specifically, exploring
how we can understand, leverage, and evaluate generative AI technologies, like **Large Language
Models(LLMs)** and **Vision Language Models** from a human-centered interactive perspective. And build interactive NLP systems
based on these explorations to enhance human decision-making collaboratively. 

Under this topic, I aim to delve deeper into [text world](https://www.textgames.org/) and multimodal emodied agent environment as a research background.
Text games serve as an abstract and highly flexible environment to study and test large language models (LLMs) and interactive systems. In my research work, I want to explore three interesting directions:
- **1.Text games and Intelligent Agents**:
Text games provide a simplified yet dynamic environment for training and evaluating intelligent agents. These agents must process natural language inputs, plan actions, and adapt to changing scenariosâ€”skills that are critical for real-world applications. Using text games to study intelligent agents' decision-making, memory, and collaboration in partially observable, multi-turn environments.
- **2. Text games and human-centered evaluation**: Moving beyond static benchmarks, I leverage text games to evaluate LLMsâ€™ reasoning, adaptability, and performance in dynamic tasks.
- **3.Text games and Real-world applications**: Applying insights from text games to develop systems for education, decision-making, and human-AI collaboration.

In the past, I also worked on conversation data analysis, Computer Vision and Driveless tasks, and some other Machel Learning algorithms.

## Honors and awards
**2022 China Nation Scholarship**: Awarded the highly competitive China National Scholarship, granted to the top 1% of students nationwide in
recognition of outstanding academic performance, research excellence, and comprehensive personal development.
